# How To Land Any Job You Apply For

Care about the company. **Do your research. **

Companies receive hundreds if not thousands of applications a day, and if you focus on only what you're looking for and what you need out of the job you're applying for, it's almost impossible to get noticed. 

When I see someone write in and say, "Here's my resume, I think I'd be a great fit. Let me know if you have any open opportunities", it requires me to do work to think about how they might fit in. I already have a full plate. I don't have time to think about how you _might _fit in. Tell me. 

Give me ideas I haven't thought about. What should we be looking out for? What could we be doing better? What opportunities are we missing out on?What connections, skills or experience do you have that could make those opportunities a reality? Tell me.

**Show me the value you'd provide immediately. ****Otherwise I don't have time to read your email. **

How can you show the value you'll provide when you're not at the company already or privy to inside information? To that I say - if I can't count on you to care enough about our company/industry/team, why should I think you'd have the self-starting attitude that is required for the way we work?

When we bring someone onto the team, it's generally because we know there is a specific gap that will be filled. And if there isn't a specific gap to be filled, it's because we see potential in the candidate.

I could care less about your resume, really. More than anything I want to see that you are resourceful. You've done your research, you took the time to craft a message that shows you've thought deeply about how you could contribute. 

To me, potential, attitude, willingness to learn, and general human-ness is more important than your resume. I could care less if you're the smartest motherf\#$%er in your field. If you can't see beyond your current skills, and don't know how to communicate and work within a team, it'll be a dead end on both sides. Especially when it comes to a remote work environment.

Something I learned from our Creative Director Leigh is to enter a working relationship assuming 100% trust with my team members, rather than the other way around. If you slowly chip away at that trust by not following through, delivering less than what you know is your best, then I'll start to lose trust and respect for you. 

A few more random tips...

Don't send a wall of text.

Don't send a one line email (unless it's accompanied by a link out to something you've created for us).

**Don't be an asshole. **

Skip the corporate speak. If I see _to whom it may concern _in an email, I skip it. Immediately. 

Believe you bring value.

Good luck.
